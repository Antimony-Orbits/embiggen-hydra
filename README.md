# Embiggen Hydra

This is a collection of Customize+ templates which enlarge various head sculpt and vanilla heads, intending to faithfully reproduce their look at larger sizes.

To use one of these upscales, copy the contents of the one you want, and paste it into a new C+ template, then add that template to a new or extant C+ profile, and enable that profile for the character you want to use it on.

If the template is for a sculpt, be sure you have the relevant sculpt mod installed and enabled too, or the upscale won't look quite right.
