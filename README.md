# Embiggen Hydra

This is a collection of Customize+ templates which enlarge various head sculpts and vanilla heads, intending to reproduce their look at larger sizes, in two categories:

**Faithful**
Faithful upscales are an attempt to accurately reproduce a sculpt or vanilla head at larger scales. Please note there is some variation from the original due to how bones get weirder the further from their usual position they are, but I've tried to make the faces still look nice across a variety of emotes, sometimes at the expense of accurately reproducing a sculpt's straight face.

**Cherub**
Cherub upscales are an attempt to make the upscaled heads look more like anime chibi's, and are often larger than Faithful upscales for a lower head to body ratio.



Preview pictures of each upscale are available in that upscales folder, per sculpt/face.

To use one of these upscales, copy the contents of the one you want, and use the "import from clipboard" feature in C+ to create a new template, then add that template to a new or existing C+ profile, and enable that profile for the character you want to use it on.

If the template is for a sculpt, be sure you have the relevant sculpt mod installed and enabled too, or the upscale won't look quite right. Links to sculpts are included in the folder of the sculpt. Make sure you match the race of your character with the appropriate race of the sculpt/face you choose the upscale for, as some upscales are split by race (and sometimes face number) due to facial bone variation between them.

## FAQ

**Q:** When I apply the upscale the face gets all weird, help!

**A:** Make sure you have the correct face sculpt mod installed (if needed for the upscale you're using). Check that your character's race, sex, and facial number are set correctly for the upscale you're using (and the sculpt mod, if using one). Check that the Penumbra mod collection (if using them) applied to your current character is the same as the one you've enabled the sculpt mod for, if using one.

**Q:** I added the upscale to C+ but nothing changed, what's wrong?

**A:** Make sure the template you imported into C+ is added to a C+ profile, and that the profile is active, and has your current character in the list of characters it applies to. Also check that no other profiles are active that also affect this character (only the profile with the highest priority number will be applied to the relevant characters it affects).

**Q:** I found a bug, or a weird appearance problem, or the face looks weird when I use a certain emote, with one of your upscales, how do I tell you about it?

**A:** Either in the issues tab here on Github, or over on discord if you know me, or somewhere I post.

**Q:** I found a bug with the C+ plugin itself, where do I report it?

**A:** There are details on how and where to report C+ plugin bugs on it's repo, over here: [GitHub - Aether-Tools/CustomizePlus](https://github.com/Aether-Tools/CustomizePlus)

**Q:** I want to use one of your upscales to make my own, is that okay?

**A:** Of course, go for it! I made these with the intention that other people would take them and run with them to make their own!

**Q:** Why "Embiggen Hydra?"

**A:** It's just a silly name I thought fitting because at the start, for every sculpt here I was making two bigger upscales of it.
