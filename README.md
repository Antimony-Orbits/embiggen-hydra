# Embiggen Hydra

This is a collection of Customize+ templates which enlarge various head sculpt and vanilla heads, intending to faithfully reproduce their look at larger sizes. Please note there is some variation from the original due to how bones get weirder the further from their usual position they are, but I've tried to make the faces still look nice across a variety of emotes, sometimes at the expense of accurately reproducing a sculpt's straight face.

Preview pictures of each upscale are available in that upscales folder, per sculpt/face.

To use one of these upscales, copy the contents of the one you want, and paste it into a new C+ template, then add that template to a new or extant C+ profile, and enable that profile for the character you want to use it on.

If the template is for a sculpt, be sure you have the relevant sculpt mod installed and enabled too, or the upscale won't look quite right. Where a sculpt is publicly available, a link to it is provided in the folder for the upscale of that sculpt. Make sure you match the race of your character with the appropriate race of the sculpt/face you choose the upscale for, as some upscales are split by race due to facial bone variation.
